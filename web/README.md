  ReconFTW WEB Interface
  <br>
</h1>

<h3 align="center">Summary</h3>

**ReconFTW** is a powerful and versatile reconnaissance tool, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute to its development with my friends Daniel **"d3vchac" Chactoura, Daniel "dd4n1b0y" Lima**, and **Matheus "mx61tt" Tucunduva**.

Over the past year, we have dedicated ourselves to creating the web interface of **ReconFTW**. Working hard to make it more intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. We also have implemented some features that make it easier for users to create their scans and get the results they need quickly and efficiently.

One of the main challenges we faced during this project was striking a balance between functionality and simplicity because we wanted to make sure that the interface was powerful enough to meet the needs of advanced users and easy for beginners to navigate. 

So, what are you waiting for? Go! Go! Go! :boom: :boom: :boom:

## How to contribute:

We tried to make the structure as simple as possible to be understood, with the intention of new collaborators being able to easily read the code and add their knowledge.

We currently have some problems, for example: we cannot load all the information from the database without the server being taken down.

We need to finalize features such as: cancel scan, backup scan, api key config.

We need help! if you have an idea or want to improve our code, please do not hesitate to contact us or contribute directly. We know that a lot can be improved and we have the humbleness to recognize this. 

Let's make history!
